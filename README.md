# RoboticArena
Project where user via command line can control a given number of 'robots' which are located on the 'arena'.

## Ok, but how does it actually work?

### System requirements
For this project you are obligated to use program **gnuplot** with **Linux** operating system. Either you can download it from [this website](http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html), or just simply use command:
>_apt-get install gnuplot_

This is because program has a communication module that operates only on the Linux OS.

### Now let's get to details
* On the start of the program, in the cartesian coordinates there are several default robots created, as well as some obstacles.
* User is equipped in some commands that he can use:
  * adding a new robot or an obstacle
  * changing the robot that is in control right now
  * moving straight by the given distance
  * rotation by the given angle
  * changing the size of a robot
  * changing the speed of robot movement
* Yes, there was a 'speed' word! There are built-in animations, of rotation and movement.
* User can end the program at any given moment.

### Some additional comments
* The program has it's own **doxy** documantation ready to be generated in the _doxy_ folder
* _Figury_ folder is used for storing .txt files with actual coordinates of existing objects
